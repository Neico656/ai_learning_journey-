# ai_learning_journey-
Hi to everyone! I'm currently learning AI mostly from scratch, basic python, numpy, linear algebra, etc... I think that deeply understanding what we are studiyng is the only path to learn something , so I really try to figure out how things work. 

In this documents you'll find different exercises I'll complete as I progress in the study of AI, and deep explanations, I hope, on mathematical and code concepts, that may probably help you too, to grasp how this state-of-art technology works from its guts. 

As I said before, I'm a beginner, for the momment you'll find easy and simple exercises everyone with a minimum of knowledge should be able to follow. I also hope that this repository help people to draw a proper path for learning truly AI without any previous knowledge even in code. 

If someone is interested, I have first learn the basics of python, and then some numpy and basic linear algebra at the moment of creating this repository . In the future who knows, but I'm planning to dive into pandas, to then switch to Pytorch or scikit-learn


Sorry, if something isn't correct or clear, and hope this can help someone.
