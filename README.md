Previous knolwdge required: Basic numpy, and pandas. 

This project is intended for machine learning beginners aiming to work with its first data, train models, and ananlyze how they work internally. 

To achieve this objective, we'll go through different phases, the first one being preprocessing, in which we'll take in the dataframe, and fill 
Nan values in a logical sense, then we will pass to train three different models, logistic regression, random_forest, and KKN. We'll also explain how each one of t

When we have finished with enhancing our models, we'll focuss on interpreting what they have to tell us, and why have they made those predictions. In order to do t

The visualizers will be used to understand which categories or features of our dataset make the most impact on its predictions, while Shap as the most powerful too

Otherwise LIME will only be use to study specific cases, without the presence of the entire group. This is a much more direct approach and let us dive the most int

Most of the files come with graphs included that represent what is in the code or what is being studied in each moment. 

Hope you can learn a lot from this project!

Pages will be indexed at the upper-left front from the first one created to the last one.
