This project aims to develop/train a model capable of analyzing data from the Titanic dataset and determining with the most possible accuracy 
whether the passsenger will survive or not based on a base of characteristics. 

To achieve this objective, we'll go through different phases, the first one being preprocessing, in which we'll take in the dataframe, and fill 
Nan values in a logical sense, and more methods we're gonna learn on the process. 

It's also my intention to create some graphics and visuals to understand it better, provide the most accurate model, comparing different ones, and clearly explain what's happening in each step of the project.
